[This](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28017289) is an interesting discussion on Hacker News for a process to learn new things quickly.
Here are some of the top answers summarized.
* For a new programming language, there are a couple of standard things you should try to implement. Write several programs where you
    * Read/write to a file
    * Turn a structured object into JSON
    * Parse JSON into an object
    * A basic script that can be run from the CLI, parses flags/args, reads stdin
    * Send a HTTP request
    * Implement a very basic web server
* When you’re doing these exercises, do not copy/paste any code. You should be typing out the code yourself.
* Try to bias towards reading (blogs, documentation, code, books, etc.) over watching video tutorials. Reading is a lot faster than watching video and you can be far more efficient with your time.
* A 3 step process for learning new frameworks is to divide it up into a week’s work (10 - 15 hour total commitment)
    * Prepare - Spend 1 hour Monday through Thursday reading documentation, books, and watching content. This way you’ll have time to sleep on the concepts.
    * Plan - On Friday, spend 1 hour preparing a small project idea for the weekend that will use all the concepts you learned over the week.
    * Project - Spend 4 - 6 hours building the project over the weekend.
